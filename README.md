# AI-project

# Summary:

A python project that starts with x agents and slowly improves through the use of neurons to more concistantly reach the goal dot.

# In-Depth:

This project uses the python library Tkinter to draw a series of dots that are controlled by neurons. At the start of the program, the dots pick random paths and follow them. These dots then use a fitness function and natural selection to create a new generation of dots that ideally should be better than the previous generation. A small amount of random mutation is also added to the dot's movements and breeding, to simulate an aspect of randomness.
